        // eg:- singleton pattern,factory pattern, builder pattern etc.

        //2.Structural design patterns - related to structure of code
        // eg:- proxy pattern, adaptor pattern etc.

        //3.Behavioral design pattern - focus on interaction of objects (make application loosely couple)
